This was built to understand file handling in C i.e. creating a file and accessing the stored data in the file, modifying and removing the stored data. Also to understand the use of functions as well as different parameters of C programming language.

### Main functions

- `void add()`: This function is used to input or add the information of new element to the program.
- `void explor()`: This function is used to explore the stored information in the file created.
- `void mainscreen()`: It is included in source code of project file in order to print the text style and to control its color.
- `void mainscreen()`: This function is used to print the main screen or menu of the project.

### Key features

- `Storage of Element Information`: You can add any new element with its name, symbol, atomic number, atomic weight and its some important properties. When new element information is to be added to this Periodic Table, you have to enter 1 in the main menu and input information in given format. These information are stored in file created on the hard disk of computer by program itself.
- `Exploration of element Information`: Another main function of this project is to explore or to display the stored information. You can search an element by using any of the following method:
- By name of element
